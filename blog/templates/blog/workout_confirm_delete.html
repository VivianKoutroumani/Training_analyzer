<!--
A user will only see this view should they decide they want to delete a workout they had entered previously. This form
gives them the option to, if they are certain, delete the workout or cancel the operation should they have second
thoughts. In the latter case, FitHub returns the user to the "details" page associated with the workout they just
tried to delete.
